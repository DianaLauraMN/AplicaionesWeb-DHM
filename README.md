# Considerations

## Important Message

**If you want to run this project "PLEASE" create a Mongo database because this project uses controllers and connectors
which works in mongoStandar**

## Database characteristics

1. The database should be with the title "AplicacionesWeb-DHM".
2. The database must have 5 collections "Comments", "Municipalities", "Posts", "States", "Users".
3. Don't change the string connection, leave "localhost" as default.

## ---IMPORTART---

**The project JARS are on relative path, this is very important to know because
you have to add the JARS manually, just open the project and go to (add JARS/folder) option
then select in the project folder the necessary Jars and that would be it**
